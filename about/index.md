# About

That's me... gripping too hard, clenching and not shifting my weight properly. I'm still learning. I'm still learning about life and about software engineering.

I've been working in the industry for over 10 years now, starting in defense for the Department of Science and Technology here in Australia. From there I moved into the private sector working for a large utilities company in the early 2000's developing an Enterprise Service Bus from the ground up using CORBA, Java and a custom DSL for service routing.

I have worked in many different industries and am currently working as a Solution Architect for a consulting company while moonlighting as Software Engineer.

The intent of this blog is to give something back to the community. I spend a heap of time solving issues internally at my company, sometimes there are no [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) posts to help solve these issues... so in a way it's kind of a medium for me giving back to the community and the Internet for being so kind and useful (time permitting of course).

I won't always be blogging about Software Engineering though. I intended to also blog about motorcycling and everything associated with that (I ride every day and love it), as well as some of my other life pursuits. I hope someone out there in the aether finds some of this content useful.
