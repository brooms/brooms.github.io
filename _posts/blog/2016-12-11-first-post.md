So this is my first official post to this blog.

I've been meaning to blog for a while now, mainly because my partner and I have vastly different professions and she doesn't really listen to me when I talk about work related topics (it works well though). So I need a platform where I can spill and unravel my thoughts while still remaining semi-anonymous. I also thought, hey, if she doesn't listen to me then might as well expand on the audience who doesn't listen.

On a personal note, my partner is a staunchly private person so I won't mention her on this blog beyond this introductory statement.

The intent of this blog is to give something back to the community. I spend a heap of time solving issues internally at my company, sometimes there are no [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) posts to help solve these issues... so in a way it's kind of a medium for me giving back to the community and the Internet for being so kind and useful (time permitting of course).

I won't always be blogging about Software Engineering though. I intended to also blog about motorcycling and everything associated with that (I ride every day and love it), as well as some of my other life pursuits such as strength training (I know, I know it's a bit vain but I do love it), wine making (a family thing), gaming (when I have time) and a few other things.

Anyway that's about it. Hope someone out there in the aether finds something of use here one day.

Oh and thanks to Michael Rose for this [theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme) that I have hacked, personalised and probably broken in the process.
